            Hyperlinks, or simply links, connect HTML pages and other resources on the web. When you include a link on your page, you enable visitors to travel from your page to another website, another page on your site, or even another location on the same page. Without links, a page stands alone, disconnected from the rest of the web. With links, that page becomes part of the almost boundless collection of information that is the World Wide Web.

        <p id="2"><dt>Basic link</dt>The element to create links is called an anchor element because you use it to anchor a URL to some text on your page. When users view your page in a browser, they can click the text to activate the link and visit the page whose URL you specified in that link. You insert the full URL in the href attribute to tell the link where to go.
            You can think of the structure of a basic link as a cheeseburger (or your preferred vegan substitute). The URL is the patty, the link text is the cheese, and the anchor tags are the buns. Tasty, yes?
            For example, if you have a web page that describes HTML standards, you may want to refer web surfers to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) — the organization that governs all things related to HTML standards.

        <p id="3"><dt>Absolute link</dt>An absolute link uses a complete URL to connect browsers to a web page or online resource. Links that use a complete URL to point to a resource are called absolute because they provide a complete, stand-alone path to another web resource. When you link to a page on someone else’s website, the web browser needs every bit of information in the URL to find that page. The browser starts with the domain in the URL and works its way through the path to a specific file. When you link to files on someone else’s site, you must always use absolute URLs in the href attribute of the anchor element. 
    Here’s an example:
    http://www.website.com/directory/page.html
    An absolute link uses a complete URL to connect browsers to a web page or online resource.
