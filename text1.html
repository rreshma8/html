        <h3>Website</h3>
        <blockquote>A collection of web pages which are grouped together and usually connected together in various ways is often called a "website" or a "site". Web Pages contain text, forms, audio and video files, streaming media, and sometimes games. Every website may look different, but all have one thing in common: Hyper Text Markup Language (also known as HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) regularly and Javascript.</blockquote>
        <p>HTML files which contain HTML code are simple text files that produce web pages.  Just like a text file you create on a Windows computer works on Linux and Mac, webpages works on any other operating system.</p>
